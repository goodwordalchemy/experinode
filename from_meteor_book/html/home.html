			<h2>What's Grapher?</h2>
				<p>It is a graphical user interface for tracking the history and progress of ideas or projects.  Think something like a to-do list where, rather than deleting items once you've completed them, you emerge from them with new ideas or tasks.  And rather than loosing track of or feeling shame at what's been left undone, an undone item remains alive and waiting.</p>
